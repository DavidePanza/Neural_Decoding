**Overview**

This repo contains scripts for performing neural decoding on EEG (electroencephalography) data. The  scripts are designed to perform neural decoding of object categories or images 
from EEG signals. The scripts are customized for my current project in which I analyze images that rely more ('Challenge') or less ('Control') on recurrent processing, as identified in a previous study (see References). The presentation times used in the study are either 2 (34 ms) or 6 (100 ms) frames.
